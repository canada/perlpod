=head1 DESCRIPTION

=begin original

Perl has two simple, built-in ways to open files: the shell way for
convenience, and the C way for precision.  The shell way also has 2- and
3-argument forms, which have different semantics for handling the filename.
The choice is yours.

=end original

Perl には、ファイルを開くための 2 つの単純な組み込みの手段があります:
便利さのためのシェル風の方法と、正確性のための C 風の方法です。
シェル風の方法には 2 引数と 3 引数があり、ファイル名の扱いに関して
異なった動作をします。
選択はあなた次第です。

=head1 Open E<agrave> la shell

(シェル風に開く)

=begin original

Perl's C<open> function was designed to mimic the way command-line
redirection in the shell works.  Here are some basic examples
from the shell:

=end original

Perl の C<open> 関数は、シェルでのコマンドラインのリダイレクトをまねて
設計されています。
以下はシェルでの基本的な例です:

    $ myprogram file1 file2 file3
    $ myprogram    <  inputfile
    $ myprogram    >  outputfile
    $ myprogram    >> outputfile
    $ myprogram    |  otherprogram 
    $ otherprogram |  myprogram

=begin original

And here are some more advanced examples:

=end original

そして以下はもう少し高度な例です:

    $ otherprogram      | myprogram f1 - f2
    $ otherprogram 2>&1 | myprogram -
    $ myprogram     <&3
    $ myprogram     >&4

=begin original

Programmers accustomed to constructs like those above can take comfort
in learning that Perl directly supports these familiar constructs using
virtually the same syntax as the shell.

=end original

上述のような方法に慣れているプログラマにとっては、Perl がシェルと事実上
同じ文法を使った親しんでいる構造に直接対応していることは
学ぶのが容易になります。

=head2 Simple Opens

(単純に開く)

=begin original

The C<open> function takes two arguments: the first is a filehandle,
and the second is a single string comprising both what to open and how
to open it.  C<open> returns true when it works, and when it fails,
returns a false value and sets the special variable C<$!> to reflect
the system error.  If the filehandle was previously opened, it will
be implicitly closed first.

=end original

C<open> 関数は 2 つの引数を取ります: 1 つめはファイルハンドルで、
2 つめは何を開くかとどう開くかで構成される単一の文字列です。
C<open> は成功すると真を返し、失敗すると偽を返して特殊変数 C<$!> に
システムエラーを反映します。
指定されたファイルハンドルが以前に開かれていた場合は、暗黙の内に
まず閉じられます。

=begin original

For example:

=end original

例えば:

    open(INFO,      "datafile") || die("can't open datafile: $!");
    open(INFO,   "<  datafile") || die("can't open datafile: $!");
    open(RESULTS,">  runstats") || die("can't open runstats: $!");
    open(LOG,    ">> logfile ") || die("can't open logfile:  $!");

=begin original

If you prefer the low-punctuation version, you could write that this way:

=end original

句読点が少ない方が好みなら、以下のようにも書けます:

    open INFO,   "<  datafile"  or die "can't open datafile: $!";
    open RESULTS,">  runstats"  or die "can't open runstats: $!";
    open LOG,    ">> logfile "  or die "can't open logfile:  $!";

=begin original

A few things to notice.  First, the leading less-than is optional.
If omitted, Perl assumes that you want to open the file for reading.

=end original

いくつか気がつくことがあります。
まず、先頭の「大なり」は省略可能です。
省略されると、Perl はファイルを読み込みのために開きたいと仮定します。

=begin original

Note also that the first example uses the C<||> logical operator, and the
second uses C<or>, which has lower precedence.  Using C<||> in the latter
examples would effectively mean

=end original

Note also that the first example uses the C<||> logical operator, and the
second uses C<or>, which has lower precedence. 
後者の例で  C<||> を使うと、実際には以下のような意味になり

    open INFO, ( "<  datafile"  || die "can't open datafile: $!" );

=begin original

which is definitely not what you want.

=end original

あなたが望んでいるのと全く違うことになります。

=begin original

The other important thing to notice is that, just as in the shell,
any whitespace before or after the filename is ignored.  This is good,
because you wouldn't want these to do different things:

=end original

他の注意するべき重要なこととしては、シェルと同様、ファイル名の前後の
空白は無視されることです。
これはよいことです; なぜなら、以下のものが違うことをすることは
望まないだろうからです:

    open INFO,   "<datafile"   
    open INFO,   "< datafile" 
    open INFO,   "<  datafile"

=begin original

Ignoring surrounding whitespace also helps for when you read a filename
in from a different file, and forget to trim it before opening:

=end original

周りの空白を無視することは、ファイル名を別のファイルから読み込んで、
開く前に空白を取り除くのを忘れたときにも助けになります:

    $filename = <INFO>;         # oops, \n still there
    open(EXTRA, "< $filename") || die "can't open $filename: $!";

=begin original

This is not a bug, but a feature.  Because C<open> mimics the shell in
its style of using redirection arrows to specify how to open the file, it
also does so with respect to extra whitespace around the filename itself
as well.  For accessing files with naughty names, see 
L<"Dispelling the Dweomer">.

=end original

これはバグではありません、仕様です。
C<open> はどのようにファイルを開くかを指定するのにリダイレクトの矢印を
使うことでシェルを真似ているので、ファイル名の周りの空白についても
同じように扱います。
行儀の悪い名前のファイルにアクセスするためには、
L<"Dispelling the Dweomer"> を参照してください。

=begin original

There is also a 3-argument version of C<open>, which lets you put the
special redirection characters into their own argument:

=end original

また、3 引数版の C<open> もあって、これは特殊なリダイレクト文字を
独立した引数にしたものです:

    open( INFO, ">", $datafile ) || die "Can't create $datafile: $!";

=begin original

In this case, the filename to open is the actual string in C<$datafile>,
so you don't have to worry about C<$datafile> containing characters
that might influence the open mode, or whitespace at the beginning of
the filename that would be absorbed in the 2-argument version.  Also,
any reduction of unnecessary string interpolation is a good thing.

=end original

この場合、開くファイル名は C<$datafile> の実際の文字列なので、
C<$datafile> に開くモードに影響を与える文字や、
2 引数版では吸収されるファイル名の先頭の空白が含まれているかどうかを
心配する必要はありません。
また、不必要な文字列変換が削減されるのもよいことです。

=head2 Indirect Filehandles

(間接ファイルハンドル)

=begin original

C<open>'s first argument can be a reference to a filehandle.  As of
perl 5.6.0, if the argument is uninitialized, Perl will automatically
create a filehandle and put a reference to it in the first argument,
like so:

=end original

C<open> の最初の引数は、ファイルハンドルへのリファレンスにすることも出来ます。
perl 5.6.0 以降、引数が初期化されていない場合、Perl は
以下のように、自動的にファイルハンドルを作成して、それへのリファレンスを
最初の引数に設定します:

    open( my $in, $infile )   or die "Couldn't read $infile: $!";
    while ( <$in> ) {
	# do something with $_
    }
    close $in;

=begin original

Indirect filehandles make namespace management easier.  Since filehandles
are global to the current package, two subroutines trying to open
C<INFILE> will clash.  With two functions opening indirect filehandles
like C<my $infile>, there's no clash and no need to worry about future
conflicts.

=end original

間接ファイルハンドルは、名前空間管理をより容易にします。
ファイルハンドルは現在のパッケージに対してグローバルなので、
二つのサブルーチンが C<INFILE> を開こうとすると衝突します。 
二つの関数が C<my $infil> のように間接ファイルハンドルで開いていると、
衝突は発生せず、将来の衝突を気にする必要もありません。

=begin original

Another convenient behavior is that an indirect filehandle automatically
closes when it goes out of scope or when you undefine it:

=end original

もう一つの便利は振る舞いとして、間接ファイルハンドルは、スコープ外に出るか
undef にされると、自動的に閉じます:

    sub firstline {
	open( my $in, shift ) && return scalar <$in>;
	# no close() required
    }

=head2 Pipe Opens

(パイプを開く)

=begin original

In C, when you want to open a file using the standard I/O library,
you use the C<fopen> function, but when opening a pipe, you use the
C<popen> function.  But in the shell, you just use a different redirection
character.  That's also the case for Perl.  The C<open> call 
remains the same--just its argument differs.

remains the same--just its argument differs.  
(TBT)

=begin original

If the leading character is a pipe symbol, C<open> starts up a new
command and opens a write-only filehandle leading into that command.
This lets you write into that handle and have what you write show up on
that command's standard input.  For example:

=end original

If the leading character is a pipe symbol, C<open> starts up a new
command and opens a write-only filehandle leading into that command.
This lets you write into that handle and have what you write show up on
that command's standard input.  For example:
(TBT)

    open(PRINTER, "| lpr -Plp1")    || die "can't run lpr: $!";
    print PRINTER "stuff\n";
    close(PRINTER)                  || die "can't close lpr: $!";

=begin original

If the trailing character is a pipe, you start up a new command and open a
read-only filehandle leading out of that command.  This lets whatever that
command writes to its standard output show up on your handle for reading.
For example:

=end original

If the trailing character is a pipe, you start up a new command and open a
read-only filehandle leading out of that command.  This lets whatever that
command writes to its standard output show up on your handle for reading.
For example:
(TBT)

    open(NET, "netstat -i -n |")    || die "can't fork netstat: $!";
    while (<NET>) { }               # do something with input
    close(NET)                      || die "can't close netstat: $!";

=begin original

What happens if you try to open a pipe to or from a non-existent
command?  If possible, Perl will detect the failure and set C<$!> as
usual.  But if the command contains special shell characters, such as
C<E<gt>> or C<*>, called 'metacharacters', Perl does not execute the
command directly.  Instead, Perl runs the shell, which then tries to
run the command.  This means that it's the shell that gets the error
indication.  In such a case, the C<open> call will only indicate
failure if Perl can't even run the shell.  See L<perlfaq8/"How can I
capture STDERR from an external command?"> to see how to cope with
this.  There's also an explanation in L<perlipc>.

=head2 The Minus File

("-" ファイル)

=begin original

Again following the lead of the standard shell utilities, Perl's
C<open> function treats a file whose name is a single minus, "-", in a
special way.  If you open minus for reading, it really means to access
the standard input.  If you open minus for writing, it really means to
access the standard output.

(TBT)

=begin original

If minus can be used as the default input or default output, what happens
if you open a pipe into or out of minus?  What's the default command it
would run?  The same script as you're currently running!  This is actually
a stealth C<fork> hidden inside an C<open> call.  See 
L<perlipc/"Safe Pipe Opens"> for details.

=head2 Mixing Reads and Writes

(読み書きを混ぜる)

=begin original

It is possible to specify both read and write access.  All you do is
add a "+" symbol in front of the redirection.  But as in the shell,
using a less-than on a file never creates a new file; it only opens an
existing one.  On the other hand, using a greater-than always clobbers
(truncates to zero length) an existing file, or creates a brand-new one
if there isn't an old one.  Adding a "+" for read-write doesn't affect
whether it only works on existing files or always clobbers existing ones.

    open(WTMP, "+< /usr/adm/wtmp")

    open(SCREEN, "+> lkscreen")
        || die "can't open lkscreen: $!";

    open(LOGFILE, "+>> /var/log/applog")
        || die "can't open /var/log/applog: $!";

=begin original

The first one won't create a new file, and the second one will always
clobber an old one.  The third one will create a new file if necessary
and not clobber an old one, and it will allow you to read at any point
in the file, but all writes will always go to the end.  In short,
the first case is substantially more common than the second and third
cases, which are almost always wrong.  (If you know C, the plus in
Perl's C<open> is historically derived from the one in C's fopen(3S),
which it ultimately calls.)

In fact, when it comes to updating a file, unless you're working on
a binary file as in the WTMP case above, you probably don't want to
use this approach for updating.  Instead, Perl's B<-i> flag comes to
the rescue.  The following command takes all the C, C++, or yacc source
or header files and changes all their foo's to bar's, leaving
the old version in the original filename with a ".orig" tacked
on the end:

One of the most common uses for C<open> is one you never

C<< <ARGV> >>, Perl actually does an implicit open 
on each file in @ARGV.  Thus a program called like this:

You are welcome to pre-process your @ARGV before starting the loop to

command options beginning with a minus.  While you can always roll the
simple ones by hand, the Getopts modules are good for this:

Yes, this also means that if you have files named "-" (and so on) in
your directory, they won't be processed as literal files by C<open>.
You'll need to pass them as "./-", much as you would for the I<rm> program,

If you want the convenience of the shell, then Perl's C<open> is

than C's simplistic fopen(3S) provides you should look to Perl's
C<sysopen>, which is a direct hook into the open(2) system call.
That does mean it's a bit more involved, but that's the price of 
precision.

The HANDLE argument is a filehandle just as with C<open>.  The PATH is
a literal path, one that doesn't pay attention to any greater-thans or
less-thans or pipes or minuses, nor ignore whitespace.  If it's there,
it's part of the path.  The FLAGS argument contains one or more values
derived from the Fcntl module that have been or'd together using the
bitwise "|" operator.  The final argument, the MASK, is optional; if
present, it is combined with the user's current umask for the creation
mode of the file.  You should usually omit this.

Although the traditional values of read-only, write-only, and read-write

(ファイルを再び開く(dup))

=begin original

Sometimes you already have a filehandle open, and want to make another
handle that's a duplicate of the first one.  In the shell, we place an
ampersand in front of a file descriptor number when doing redirections.
For example, C<< 2>&1 >> makes descriptor 2 (that's STDERR in Perl)
be redirected into descriptor 1 (which is usually Perl's STDOUT).
The same is essentially true in Perl: a filename that begins with an
ampersand is treated instead as a file descriptor if a number, or as a
filehandle if a string.

existing one using the fdopen(3S) library call.  This is slightly more

One clever move with STDOUT is to explicitly close it when you're done

明示的に閉じることです。

    END { close(STDOUT) || die "can't close stdout: $!" }

=begin original

If you don't do this, and your program fills up the disk partition due
to a command line redirection, it won't report the error exit with a
failure status.

=end original

これをしないままで、このプログラムがコマンドラインリダイレクトによって
ディスクをいっぱいにしてしまっても、失敗状態でエラー終了しません。

You don't have to accept the STDIN and STDOUT you were given.  You are
welcome to reopen them if you'd like.

与えられた STDIN と STDOUT を受け入れる必要はありません。

    open(STDIN, "< datafile")
	|| die "can't open datafile: $!";

    open(STDOUT, "> output")
	|| die "can't open output: $!";

=begin original

And then these can be accessed directly or passed on to subprocesses.
This makes it look as though the program were initially invoked
with those redirections from the command line.

=end original

それからこれらは直接アクセスしたり子プロセスに渡したりできます。

It's probably more interesting to connect these to pipes.  For example:

これらをパイプにつなぐ方がより興味深いでしょう。
例えば:

    $pager = $ENV{PAGER} || "(less || more)";
    open(STDOUT, "| $pager")
	|| die "can't fork a pager: $!";

=begin original

This makes it appear as though your program were called with its stdout
already piped into your pager.  You can also use this kind of thing
in conjunction with an implicit fork to yourself.  You might do this
if you would rather handle the post processing in your own program,
just in a different process:

=end original

これによって、プログラムの標準出力がが既にページャとパイプで
つながれているかのように見えます。
このようなことはまた、自分自身を暗黙に fork したものと結合するためにも
使えます。
自分自身のプログラムの別のプロセスでで後処理を扱いたい場合、
以下のようにできます:

    head(100);
    while (<>) {
        print;
    } 

    sub head {
        my $lines = shift || 20;
        return if $pid = open(STDOUT, "|-");       # return if parent
        die "cannot fork: $!" unless defined $pid;
        while (<STDIN>) {
            last if --$lines < 0;
            print;
        } 
        exit;
    }

    while (defined($file = readdir(DIR))) {
        # do something with "$dirname/$file"
    }
    closedir(DIR);

If you want to process directories recursively, it's better to use the
File::Find module.  For example, this prints out all files recursively
and adds a slash to their names if the file is a directory.

what it points to.  Or, if you want to know I<what> it points to, then
C<readlink> is called for:

Rather than losing yourself in a morass of twisting, turning C<ioctl>s,
all dissimilar, if you're going to manipulate ttys, it's best to
make calls out to the stty(1) program if you have it, or else use the
portable POSIX interface.  To figure this all out, you'll need to read the
termios(3) manpage, which describes the POSIX interface to tty devices,
and then L<POSIX>, which describes Perl's interface to POSIX.  There are
also some high-level modules on CPAN that can help you with these games.
Check out Term::ReadKey and Term::ReadLine.

=head2 Opening Sockets

(ソケットを開く)

=begin original

What else can you open?  To open a connection using sockets, you won't use
one of Perl's two open functions.  See 
L<perlipc/"Sockets: Client/Server Communication"> for that.  Here's an 
example.  Once you have it, you can use FH as a bidirectional filehandle.

=end original

他の何を開けるの?
ソケットを使った接続を開くには、Perl の 2 つの open 関数のどちらも
使いません。
そのためには L<perlipc/"Sockets: Client/Server Communication"> を
参照してください。
以下は例です。
これを実行すると、FH を双方向ファイルハンドルとして使えます。

    use IO::Socket;
    local *FH = IO::Socket::INET->new("www.perl.com:80");

For opening up a URL, the LWP modules from CPAN are just what
the doctor ordered.  There's no filehandle interface, but
it's still easy to get the contents of a document:

=head2 Binary Files

(バイナリファイル)

=begin original

On certain legacy systems with what could charitably be called terminally
convoluted (some would say broken) I/O models, a file isn't a file--at
least, not with respect to the C standard I/O library.  On these old
systems whose libraries (but not kernels) distinguish between text and
binary streams, to get files to behave properly you'll have to bend over
backwards to avoid nasty problems.  On such infelicitous systems, sockets
and pipes are already opened in binary mode, and there is currently no
way to turn that off.  With files, you have more options.

Passing C<sysopen> a non-standard flag option will also open the file in
binary mode on those systems that support it.  This is the equivalent of
opening the file normally, then calling C<binmode> on the handle.

=head2 File Locking

(ファイルのロック)

=begin original

In a multitasking environment, you may need to be careful not to collide
with other processes who want to do I/O on the same files as you
are working on.  You'll often need shared or exclusive locks
on files for reading and writing respectively.  You might just
pretend that only exclusive locks exist.

=end original

マルチタスク環境では、あなたが触ろうとしているファイルと同じファイルを
他のプロセスが衝突しないように気をつける必要があります。
しばしば、ファイルを読み込みまたは書き込みするために、それぞれ
共有ロックと排他ロックが必要になります。
あるいは、単に排他ロックしかないような振りをするかもしれません。

=begin original

Never use the existence of a file C<-e $file> as a locking indication,
because there is a race condition between the test for the existence of
the file and its creation.  It's possible for another process to create
a file in the slice of time between your existence check and your attempt
to create the file.  Atomicity is critical.

Perl's most portable locking interface is via the C<flock> function,
whose simplicity is emulated on systems that don't directly support it
such as SysV or Windows.  The underlying semantics may affect how
it all works, so you should learn how C<flock> is implemented on your
system's port of Perl.

File locking I<does not> lock out another process that would like to
do I/O.  A file lock only locks out others trying to get a lock, not
processes trying to do I/O.  Because locks are advisory, if one process
uses locking and another doesn't, all bets are off.

By default, the C<flock> call will block until a lock is granted.
A request for a shared lock will be granted as soon as there is no
exclusive locker.  A request for an exclusive lock will be granted as
soon as there is no locker of any kind.  Locks are on file descriptors,
not file names.  You can't lock a file until you open it, and you can't
hold on to a lock once the file has been closed.

=head2 IO Layers

(IO 層)

=begin original

In Perl 5.8.0 a new I/O framework called "PerlIO" was introduced.
This is a new "plumbing" for all the I/O happening in Perl; for the
most part everything will work just as it did, but PerlIO also brought
in some new features such as the ability to think of I/O as "layers".
One I/O layer may in addition to just moving the data also do
transformations on the data.  Such transformations may include
compression and decompression, encryption and decryption, and transforming
between various character encodings.
